This is my course assignment for the course JavaScript 2 at Noroff. The course spanned over six weeks and we were tasked with producing "a new JavaScript front-end client for an existing social media platform".

The task was strickly about JavaScript and was not graded based on appaerance, HTML or CSS. I chose because of this to only work with premade Bootstrap components.

## Live app

This project is deployed on [Netlify](https://js2-ca-dwnwnd.netlify.app/) from the branch called `js2`.

## API

I've used the [Noroff V2](https://v2.api.noroff.dev/docs/static/index.html) API for this task.

## Course goal

The goal of this course was to:

- Become confident in using provided `API`and `API documentation`
- Learn how to use `GET`, `POST`, `PUT` and `DELETE` HTTP method
- Being able to create a functioning `user interface` that allows for viewing, posting, editign and deleting social media content
- Become confident in using Github `Pull Requests`, `Branches` and `Commits`

### Required features

The following user stories were required for a passing submission:

- User with `@stud.noroff.no` email can register profile
- Registered user can `login`
- User can `view` a post content feed
- User can `filter` the post content feed
- User can `search` the post content feed
- User can `view` a post content item `by ID`
- User can `create a post` content item
- User can `update a post` content item
- User can `delete a post` content item

### Additional features

The following user stories were optional:

- User can `create a comment` on a post
- User can `edit profile media`
- User can `follow/unfollow` a profile
- User can `react to a post` content item

### Assignment Restrictions

The course assignment was restricted by:

- Required functionality had to be implemented in original, `pure JavaScript`.
- A CSS Framework could be used to build the application UI.
- A `.gitignore file` had to be provided `including node_modules`. This folder must be untracked.
- Content posted on the API is public and associated with your identity. Be appropriate and respectful.
